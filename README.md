# The Learning Repo

The goal is to learn and practice new technologies and concepts. There is a far-distant
goal of implementing a database engine (you can read more [here](https://mirror-labs.github.io/)).
But, for now, I'm just trying to learn and practice new things.

Specifically, I want to learn more about the following:

- [ ] [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
  - I think Rust would be the right choice for a database engine. It is low-level, secure
    and can easily be compiled into web assembly for use in the browser. One of the key requirements
    for my database engine.
- [ ] [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/)
- [ ] Datalog
- [ ] b-tree
- [ ] Distributed Systems
- [ ] ..and more
